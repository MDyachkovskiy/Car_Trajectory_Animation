<h1 align="center" id="title">Car Trajectory Animation App</h1>

<p id="description">
  This educational project was completed as part of studies at Geekbrains. Application written in Kotlin. This application serves as a visual tool for simulating car movements on a map. 
  
  Random Trajectory Generation:
  The application dynamically generates a random trajectory on the map. The trajectory is designed with multiple turns and curves to simulate a realistic path a vehicle might take on the road.
  
  Car Icon Animation:
  A car icon is animated to move along the generated trajectory. The animation is smooth, providing a visual representation of a car navigating through the set path on the map. The car icon is not only animated to move along the path but also to rotate and change direction according to the trajectory. This adds an additional layer of realism, as the car icon visually aligns with the direction of the path.
